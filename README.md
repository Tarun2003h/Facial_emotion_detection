# Facial_emotion_detection
Using deeplearning(opencv),python
Humans communicate using facial expressions as well as other body language and verbal cues. Researchers are using deep learning approaches in artificial intelligence research as a way to help make decisions. They need to study people in order to predict how they'll respond or know what they're feeling. This study proposes the development of a system that predicts and classifies facial emotions by using the Convolution Neural Network algorithm, among other features.

Data preprocessing, facial feature extraction, and facial emotion classification are the three key steps in this notebook. Facial expressions were predicted with 62.66% accuracy using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This algorithm was evaluated on a database from FER2013 database, which has 35887 48x48 grayscale images representing each of the emotions.
